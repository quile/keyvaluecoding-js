# Key-Value Coding #

This is a SUPER rough port from TWO other languages (Perl and Objective-J)
of a rough approximation of a weird version of NSKeyValueCoding.

## Background ##

The NSKeyValueCoding "category" that is part of the Foundation
framework for OSX and iOS programming is one of those amazing
things that you think you can live without until you've actually
used it - and after that, you can't possibly do anything without it.

I wrote a super-broken version of it for Perl back in 2001 but even
in its weird state it still saved my arse more times than I can count.
This is a javascript version of KeyValueCoding.
